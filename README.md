🐍 Classic Snake Game - Python Project

Welcome to my version of the classic Snake game, built with Python and the Turtle graphics library! 🎨🐢
This project uses a modular file structure for better organization and maintainability.

✨ Features:

Classic snake movement 🐍
Score tracking and High Score saving (using data.txt) 🏆
Responsive controls using arrow keys 🎮
Modular code with separate classes: Snake, Food, Scoreboard 📂
Simple yet addictive gameplay experience

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Python 3
Turtle (for graphics)
File Handling (saving the High Score)

📂 Project Structure

│
├── snake.py          # Handles the Snake behavior (movement, growth)
├── food.py           # Controls the Food's random appearance
├── scoreboard.py     # Manages Score and High Score saving
├── main.py           # Main game loop
├── data.txt          # Stores High Score (auto-created/updated)
└── README.md         # Project documentation

🎮 How to Play:

Run main.py to start the game.
Use the arrow keys to move the snake:
Up: ⬆️
Down: ⬇️
Left: ⬅️
Right: ➡️
Eat the food to grow.
Avoid hitting the walls or yourself!
Try to beat your High Score!

💡 Inspiration:

I built this project to practice:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 🧠
File I/O in Python 📂
Working with GUI libraries 🎨
Project structuring into multiple modules 📚
